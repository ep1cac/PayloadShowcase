# Payload Template Showcase
## Description
This repository contains a basic payload template originally designed to demonstrate antivirus evasion techniques. 

Please note: This template is no longer effective as of August 23, 2025. It also intentionally contains multiple detectable elements such as hardcoded strings, residual memory artifacts that persist in the heap after execution, etc. These characteristics make it unsuitable for stealth or real-world evasion scenarios, so please don't test it on systems without explicit permission.

## Features
- Sleep timing to bypass simple heuristics evasion. 
- XOR encryption to evade static analysis.
- Process injection to inject into remote processes to reduce suspicion.
